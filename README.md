# OpenLibrarian
 Open Librarian is a website for tracking and sharing a love of books. It utilizes the Nostr protocol so that users can bring their friends and social connections with them, and take them elsewhere if they'd like to. 

## Goals
- To broaden the specific application base of the Nostr network and allow/encourage specialisation to take place 
- Make a fun, easy to use book tracking app which includes:
  - Library shelves
  - Personal reading challenges
  - Book reviews
  - Reading progress
  - Book-related social groups
